# Restaurant Order Calculator – Prototype

This repository contains the Step 2 Prototype for my CIS 2085 Java Final Project.

## 📌 Overview
This is a Java console application built in NetBeans that allows a user to:
- View a restaurant menu stored in parallel arrays  
- Select items and quantities  
- Validate menu choices and quantity inputs  
- Add multiple items to an order  
- View an order summary  
- Calculate the subtotal using a dedicated method  

This version focuses on core Programming I concepts:
- Arrays  
- Loops (`for` and `while`)  
- Conditionals (`if/else`)  
- Scanner user input  
- Methods with parameters and return values  
- Formatted output (`printf`)  

Features such as tax, random discount, and tip will be added in Step 3.
